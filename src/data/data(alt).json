But how is the end of a product’s life cycle defined and how is the process legitimized? Upon weaving together naturally dyed and synthetically dyed yarn qualities, contrast emerges over time due the difference in lightfastness. Sections that fade at varying tempos create a completely new, vibrant surface aesthetic using the process of transience. Here, ‘wear‘ receives the status of a stand-alone quality. In cooperation with the company Aquafil the 100% regenerated nylon yarn ECONYL was sponsored.
